# navigation_v1

I want to build a small robot with lidar, IMU and odometry on board. Actually I decided to make as much as possible on computer by simulations. I know that the better will be working with real sensors, but in this project I want to learn something about sensor modeling techniques. The second thing is that computer simulation could be calculated much more faster than working on real-life robot. 

When I finish simulations and tests, I will build real robot and then test it in real life. Thats why simulations are implemented in such a way to be easy convertable to robot. I will be able to compare results.

I will describe how to use the lib, but actually this is early phase.
